                                <li> Learn how to turn off the electricity, gas, and water. Strong earth movement might harm your pipes and result in a leak. Additionally, an undiscovered gas leak could find an ignition source and could lead to fire and an explosion.
                                    <li> Transfer large objects to the floor or low shelves. Transfer heavy and unsecured items away from doors and escape routes.
